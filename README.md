It's a very useful Calculator which is very similar to the calculator we use on our digital devices and it performs operations like + , - ,  * , /  by taking new inputs and also on the result of previous operations and gives accurate results.

Initially the Calculator takes  two numbers as input from the user and performs operations on them.
Then it asks if the user wants to continue or not.

But if the user types N then,
  this calculator clears the screen and starts all over from the beginning showing logo only  and asks the user for two new numbers to perform operations on.
